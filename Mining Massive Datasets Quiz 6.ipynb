      "You may have the correct method, but have chosen the wrong line as the maximum-margin separator. Remember that you have to minimize the length of the vector w when you put the separating line in the form w.x+b=0. Here is an outline of how to work this problem.\n",
      "* Start by finding the lines through the two positive points and through the two negative points. Put these lines in slope-intercept form. That is, if v is the vertical axis and u the horizontal axis, write the equation of the line as v=c+au.\n",
      "* Find the parallel line through the closer of the points on the other side. Remember that parallel lines have the same slope; only the intercept c can change.\n",
      "* Having found the proper parallel line, find the line midway between them by averaging their intercepts --- the c values.\n",
      "* Now, write the equation of this line as w.x+b=0.\n",
      "* Scale the constants w=(w1,w2) and b, so that for positive x, the left side w.x+b is at least 1, but is exactly 1 for the closest (to the boundary) of the positive points. Also, the left side must be at most -1 for negative points, but must be exactly -1 for the closest of them."
